Codes are tested on both iris and moons dataset

Knn.py file contains code of K Nearest Neighbour 
Centroid_classifier.py file contains code of Centroid classifier
Perceptron.py file contains code of Perceptron ie a linear classifier with SGD,Batch and mini Batch implementations
Backpropagate_scratch.py file contains code of Multi layer Perceptron with back propagation and different activation functions are used that can be passed as a parameter to the function implementing the MLP , there can be multiple hidden layers with multiple nodes in each layer
Backpropagate_velocity.py file contains code of Multi layer Perceptron with back propagation and in SGD momentum and velocity parameters are included that can be passed as a parameter to the function implementing the MLP


Various png files shows the ouput that we got on running MLP code with different dataset and a comparison of activation functions has also been done between our code and SK learn's implementation
